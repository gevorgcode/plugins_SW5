## Usage
The `Log` model is used to log events in the multiuser accounts plugin. For each significant action, a new log entry will be created to provide an audit trail and ensure that changes can be traced back to the user who performed them.

## Example Log Entry
When a user changes the role of another user, a log entry is created with the following information:
- **Action**: "Role Updated"
- **Timestamp**: The date and time of the change
- **Details**: "User role changed from 'User' to 'Admin'."

## Purpose
This model helps maintain accountability and transparency by tracking actions performed within the multiuser account system.
